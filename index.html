          <p>Fear Not (Behind the Set), Fall 2015</p>
          <p>"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” - Isaiah 41:10</p>
          <p>We’ve all experienced fear in some way or another. We’re afraid of rejection, failure, uncertainty, and inadequacy. It becomes our mission to succeed, to not allow our fears to become a reality. After coming up empty, we are too tired to do anything. We can choose to do nothing, to let our fear paralyze, torment, strangle us. But when we realize that we’ve been adopted by a loving and perfect Father, what do we have to fear? Our identity as children of God frees us from the bondage of fear that controls our every move and invades our every thought. We are no longer slaves to fear, we are children of God.</p>

          <p>Social Injustice: Make It Well, Spring 2015</p>
          <p>The world is wrought with injustice. The human race cries, sweats, suffers, and dies, fighting against the will, and our hearts break as we read headlines, listen to the news, and experience it ourselves - But there is a God whose heart breaks more so than ours. God, who is Justice, gave us Jesus Christ, a man who suffered the greatest injustice so that the world would have hope. </p>
          <p>Come explore issues of prostitution, war, domestic violence, slavery and racial prejudice with us, as we come to awareness and a better understanding that there is a better future. Social injustice exists but we sing “It is well with our souls” only because these are temporary afflictions when we are reminded that there is an eternal life with our Father.</p>
