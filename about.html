	          <p>Abba Modern's story is one of challenge and growth, passion, and God's faithfulness - we believe that even the history of Abba Modern is a testimony to how He is good, specific, and better than our wildest dreams. In 2008, a handful of students from different churches and on-campus fellowships as well as different UC Berkeley dance organizations came together to create art that reflected their faith. It was a very humble beginning - cramming in practices, performing at fellowship events, testing the limits of "let's see how it goes." But their medleys were received with excitement and intrigue and the little team felt that there might be something more to this rag tag group of Christian dancers.</p>
	          <p>In its attempt to formalize, the young Abba Modern struggled. They desired for Abba Modern to be birthed out of God's heart - to build on His vision and direction, not just the fumes of a successful season. After much prayer, conversation, and dreaming, the team in its present form came to be. The goal? To be an intersection of God and dance - to be His hands and feet in the UC Berkeley dance community by loving each other and their community well and by producing impeccable art.</p>
	          <p>In an environment as supportive as UC Berkeley's Dance Community, Abba Modern grew to be well-loved, honing in on different styles of dance expression to tell the stories of its members' faith. Abba Modern relished in new performance opportunities that extended beyond UC Berkeley to the greater Bay Area dance community. The original team and its leaders graduated college - beginning an amazing cycle of growth as new dancers joined and found a home in Abba Modern. The list of milestones will hopefully continue to grow, but even beyond that, it is the understanding of God's faithfulness to this team that spurs on Abba Modern.</p>
