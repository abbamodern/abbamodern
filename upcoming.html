          		<div class="info-header">Spring 2016 Auditions!</div>
          			<p>We can’t wait to welcome some new additions to our Abba family! Abba Modern is a Christ-centered dance group at UC Berkeley that aims to spread Jesus's love to the dance community through the art of dance and testimony. Abba Modern seeks to be a community for Christian dancers who strive to be a light for God in the dance community. Come out to our auditions this fall if you're interested in joining us, or even just to learn a fun workshop piece!</p>
          			<p>We have a 3-part application process which include dance, written application, and interview.</p>
          			<p>All levels of dance experience are welcome! Even if you have an inkling, a small interest, a wonderment, a curiosity (no dance experience is required), we encourage you to come and at least dance with us! (Coming to the audition doesn’t mean you have to audition.)</p>
          			<p>Our dance audition will be held on the following days. You only need to attend one of the days.</p>
          			<p>Auditions: TBA <br> Make Ups: TBA</p>
          			<p>If you're interested in auditioning for Abba Modern, come to either our Audition or Make-up audition day to learn and perform the audition piece. Also, you must fill out this <a href="img/abba modern application.docx">WRITTEN APPLICATION</a> by SOMETIME at 11:59pm and send it to abbamoderndirectors@gmail.com. After reviewing the dance auditions and written applications, we will be contacting several applicants for an interview later that week.</p>

          		<div class="info-header">Introducing: Project Light!</div>
